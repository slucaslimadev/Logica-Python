# AI Agent Instructions for Logica-Python

This repository contains Python programming logic exercises organized by difficulty level. Here's what you need to know to assist effectively:

## Project Structure

- Root directory contains numbered exercise files (`ex01.py`, `ex02.py`, etc.)
- Each exercise corresponds to problems listed in `README.md`
- Solutions should be self-contained in individual files
- Exercise difficulty increases progressively

## Coding Conventions

1. **Input/Output Format**
   - Use `input()` for user input
   - Print clear prompts for users (e.g., `"Digite seu nome:"`)
   - Format output using f-strings (e.g., `f"Seu nome é {nome}"`)
   - All text should be in Portuguese

2. **Exercise Patterns**
   - Each file focuses on a single problem
   - Solutions should be simple and straightforward
   - Include problem-specific print headers (e.g., `"--- SOMA DE DOIS NÚMEROS ---"`)
   - Validate user input where appropriate

## Current Progress

- Exercise 1 (ex01.py): Completed - Basic name input/output
- Exercise 2 (ex02.py): In progress - Number addition program

## Development Guidelines

1. Match the difficulty level appropriate to the exercise number (see README.md sections)
2. Follow existing code style in completed exercises
3. Keep solutions beginner-friendly and well-commented
4. Use only Python standard library (no external dependencies)

## Common Patterns to Follow

```python
# Example input/output pattern
valor = input("Digite o valor: ")
print(f"O resultado é {valor}")

# Example calculation pattern
resultado = calculo(valor)
print(f"O resultado é {resultado}")
```
